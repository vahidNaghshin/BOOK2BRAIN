# Book2Brain

Turn books into a searchable knowledge base. Books are uploaded as PDF, EPUB or DOCX files, stored safely on disk, and tracked in PostgreSQL (with pgvector for later phases).

**Status:** Day 2 — database schema, migrations, book upload and library. Parsing and OCR come next.

## Prerequisites

- Git
- Python 3.12
- Docker with Docker Compose
- Tesseract OCR (macOS: `brew install tesseract`)

## Getting started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vahidNaghshin/BOOK2BRAIN.git
cd BOOK2BRAIN
```

### 2. Create the Python environment

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and replace `change-me` with a password of your choice. Use the same password in both `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `DATABASE_URL`.

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `POSTGRES_DB` | Database name (`book2brain`) |
| `POSTGRES_USER` | Application database user |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Database password (required) |
| `POSTGRES_PORT` | Port published on localhost (default `5432`) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | SQLAlchemy connection URL used by the app and by migrations |
| `STORAGE_ROOT` | Where original uploaded files are stored (default `storage`; relative paths are resolved from the project root, absolute paths can be anywhere) |
| `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB` | Maximum upload size in MB (default `100`) |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level (default `INFO`) |
| `TEST_DATABASE_URL` | Optional database for the test suite (see [Tests](#tests)) |

If you change `POSTGRES_PORT`, change the port in `DATABASE_URL` too. Special characters in the password must be URL-encoded in `DATABASE_URL`.

To accept uploads larger than 100 MB, raise `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB` **and** `maxUploadSize` in `.streamlit/config.toml` (Streamlit's own cap).

### 4. Start the database

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```

Wait until the `db` service shows `healthy`. Data is kept in the `pgdata` Docker volume.

### 5. Create the database tables

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

This runs the migrations in `database/migrations/`, creating the `books`, `documents`, `processing_runs` and `processing_errors` tables and enabling the pgvector extension. Run it again after pulling new migrations; it is safe to repeat.

### 6. Launch the application

```bash
streamlit run app/main.py
```

Open http://localhost:8501. The page shows the title, version and database status, with three tabs:

- **Upload** — choose a PDF, EPUB or DOCX file, enter the book metadata (title is required) and upload it.
- **Library** — all uploaded documents with title, author, format, size, upload date and processing status, plus a details view for each book and its documents.
- **Processing status** — placeholder for Day 3.

## Uploads

- Allowed types: `.pdf`, `.epub`, `.docx`. The file **content** is checked, not just the extension or the browser-supplied MIME type.
- Files above `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB`, empty files and invalid files are rejected with a clear message.
- Every file is hashed with SHA-256. Uploading the same file again is rejected as a duplicate: no second copy is stored and no second record is created.
- A book is identified by its title and author (case-insensitive). Uploading another format of the same book (same title and author) attaches a new document to the existing book; the existing book's metadata is left unchanged.
- Files are stored under `STORAGE_ROOT/original/<document-uuid>/<document-uuid>.<ext>`. The original filename is kept in the database only. If saving the file or the database record fails, neither is kept.

## Common tasks

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Stop the database | `docker compose stop` |
| Delete the database and its data | `docker compose down -v` |
| Apply migrations | `alembic upgrade head` |
| Show the current migration | `alembic current` |
| Create a migration after changing models | `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe change"` (review the generated file) |
| Roll back the last migration | `alembic downgrade -1` |
| Run tests | `pytest` |

If you change the database password in `.env` after the first start, run `docker compose down -v` and start the database again, because the password is only applied when the volume is created.

## Tests

```bash
docker compose up -d   # tests need PostgreSQL
pytest
```

Database tests use a separate database named after yours with a `_test` suffix (for example `book2brain_test`). It is created automatically and built with the real migrations, and your data is never touched. To use a different one, set `TEST_DATABASE_URL`; its name must contain `_test`. Uploaded files in tests go to temporary directories.

## Troubleshooting the database connection

Check the connection from the project folder, with the venv active:

```bash
python -m database.connection
```

The app shows the same message under the title.

| Message contains | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| `password authentication failed` | The password in `DATABASE_URL` doesn't match the one the database was created with. Make both passwords in `.env` match. If you changed the password after the first start, run `docker compose down -v` and `docker compose up -d`. This deletes the database data. |
| `password authentication failed` or `role "book2brain" does not exist`, with a local PostgreSQL installed | Another PostgreSQL server is already using port 5432, so the app connects to it instead of the container. Check with `lsof -nP -iTCP:5432 -sTCP:LISTEN`. Stop the other server, or set `POSTGRES_PORT=5433` and use port 5433 in `DATABASE_URL`, then run `docker compose up -d`. |
| `Connection refused` | Nothing is listening on the port in `DATABASE_URL`. Check that `docker compose ps` shows the port mapping (for example `0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp`) and that the port matches `POSTGRES_PORT`. |
| `DATABASE_URL is not set` | `.env` is missing. Run the app from the project folder after `cp .env.example .env`. |
| `relation "books" does not exist` | The tables haven't been created. Run `alembic upgrade head`. |

## Project layout

```
app/
  main.py          Streamlit entry point
  config.py        Settings (environment variables)
  schemas.py       Pydantic models (book metadata, read models)
  ui/              Streamlit pages: upload.py, library.py
  services/        Business logic: book_service, document_service, storage_service, file_validation
  repositories/    Database queries
database/
  connection.py    Engine, sessions, connection check
  models/          SQLAlchemy models (Book, Document, ProcessingRun, ProcessingError)
  migrations/      Alembic migrations (configured by alembic.ini)
  init/            Scripts run when the Docker database is first created
ingestion/         Reserved for Day 3 parsing
storage/           Default location of uploaded files (git-ignored)
tests/             pytest suite
```

The layers are kept separate: the UI calls services, services call repositories and the storage backend, and only repositories talk to the database. Storage sits behind the `StorageBackend` interface in `storage_service.py`, so cloud storage can be added later.
